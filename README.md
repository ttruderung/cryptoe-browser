# CRYPTOE -- CRYPTO made Easy

Cryptoe is a high-level crypto library providing smooth and
convenient interoperability between different
languages/platforms, including client-side web applications (run
in a browser, where the cryptographic primitives are provided via
the Web Cryptogarphy API) and server-server side
languages/platforms such as node.js.

**Cryptoe-node** is the version of cryptoe for node.js.


*The library is very much under construction.*

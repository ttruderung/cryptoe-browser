# CRYPTOE - Crypto made Easy

Cryptoe is a high-level crypto library providing 
interoperability between the client-side web applications (run
in a browser, where the cryptographic primitives are provided via
the Web Cryptogarphy API) and server-server side applications.

**Cryptoe-browser** is the client-side javascript version of
cryptoe. It is implemented using the Web Cryptography API.

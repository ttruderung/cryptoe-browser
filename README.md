# CRYPTOE -- CRYPTO made Easy

Cryptoe is a high-level crypto library providing smooth and
convenient interoperability between different
languages/platforms, including client-side web applications (run
in a browser, where the cryptographic primitives are provided via
the Web Cryptogarphy API) and server-server side
languages/platforms such as node.js.

**Cryptoe-browser** is the client-side javascript version of
cryptoe. It is implemented using the Web Cryptography API. 


*The library is very much under construction.*
